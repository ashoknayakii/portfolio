        <p>I am a full stack developer with a background in creative writing and customer service.  I have been writing, producing, collaborating and performing as an artist in NYC for the last 10 years.  
            In addition, I have worked at some of New Yorkâ€™s best restaurants and am familiar with high pressure customer service environments.  I have begun work as a freelancer developing websites for 
            artists in both the music and restaurant industries.  My mission is to create software that aids artists by creating the necessary infrastructure to give them a stronger platform for success.  </p>
